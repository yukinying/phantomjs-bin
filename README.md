# phantomjs-bin

This repository served as a temporary space for storing the binary of Phantomjs v2 of different platforms that I would need to use, and no public source of those are avaiable.

Here is a list of those platforms (see tags / releases for the list as well):

- Debian 8: Jessie
  - rationale: libjpeg, libicu* are updated and the Debian 7 version no longer works.
